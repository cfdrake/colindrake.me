Currently, I work at [Tuple Labs](https://wearetuple.co), a digital product agency in Austin, TX, where I do both native iOS and frontend web development work for our clients, mostly in the fintech sector.

In the past, I've worked for [Dynamit Technologies](http://dynamit.com) and [The Ohio State University](https://osu.edu), and have also held internships
with [Google](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) and [Cisco](https://cisco.com) in the past. While I specialize in mobile development, I've also been exposed to everything from
web backends to BIOS driver development with this experience.

I have done iOS work for clients including [Thorntons](http://www.thorntonsinc.com), [Panda Express](https://www.pandaexpress.com), [NJASAP](https://www.njasap.com),
[Hilton](https://hilton.com), and [Alliance Data](http://www.alliancedata.com/), covering both App Store, in-house, and complex white-labeled deployments.

A more detailed work history is on my [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cfdrake) profile.
