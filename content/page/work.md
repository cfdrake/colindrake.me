Currently, I work for [Tuple Labs](https://wearetuple.co), a digital product agency, doing both native iOS and frontend web development.

During my time as an app developer, I've published iOS apps for [Thorntons](http://www.thorntonsinc.com/), [Panda Express](https://www.pandaexpress.com/),
and [NJASAP](https://www.njasap.com/) in the App Store, and also built an internal app for [Hilton Hotels](https://hilton.com).
Additionally, I was part of a team that wrote a fully configurable iOS app plugin powering digital card management
for many retailer apps.

I've worked for [Dynamit Technologies](http://dynamit.com) and [The Ohio State University](https://osu.edu),
and have interned with [Google](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) and [Cisco](https://cisco.com) in the past. I
love to learn new technologies, and have experience working on platforms ranging from mobile apps and web backends to
low-level BIOS drivers and command line Linux programs.

For a complete work history, take a look at my [resume](/resume.html) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cfdrake) profile. Additionally,
presentations I've given at work are available on [Github](https://github.com/cfdrake/talks).
